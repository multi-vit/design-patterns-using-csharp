# Design Patterns using C# and .NET Core

## SOLID Principles

A mnemonic acronym, representing 5 object-oriented principles.

### Single Responsibility Principle

A class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality.

### Open/closed Principle

Open to extension, closed to modification.

### Liskov Substitution

Also known as _substitutability_. You should be able to use a subclass in place of its parent class.

### Interface segregation

A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement.

### Dependency inversion

Your classes and modules should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
